            "To be honest, I always come here whenever I hang around in the city. Tonight, we come by to get some sweet potato chips and the octopus balls and we had to wait for 25mins just for those two items without any apologise. The service was very bad - the two girls serving were obviously showing bad attitude to my friends when they came to order and when they came back around 20mins later to ask about our food after waiting for so long. They weren\u2019t friendly at all not only to us but also to other customers. About food wise, the sweet potato chips was over cooked as can be seen it turns out with a pretty dark color and taste bitter so we can\u2019t even eat them at all. It is very disappointing for me as I have been coming to the place since your first opening date. I expected more than that although it\u2019s just for two simple items or more. For this time, it\u2019s not only a waste of time but also our money - waiting for nothing tonight. Hope you can quickly train your staff well and improve the food quality.To be honest, I always come here whenever I hang around in the city.

And the worst thing is... both staff working in the shop are NOT WEARING A MASK! Isn't this is illegal? To be honest i will walk away from your store if not because of i had an online order. Then, when i ate the chicken,  the Hot chicken is not hot, and not seasoning well, half of the chicken are tasteless and all seasoning are on another side. But the Mild chicken ribs are way too hot! Did they actually read the order properly?

Knowing this, the season on my chicken wasn't sufficient, but I am fine with that (since I don't like choking on powder), but others may not be, so hopefully this is addressed for the next visit.The drinks they serve is pretty good too. Not the best in the area, since there are lots of competition, but for the price based on the promotion, it is good.The chicken that we ordered had a good coating around it and the chicken wasn't dry. The size was good, and the additional bag provided to us was good so that our hands and fingers aren't drenched with oil.With the disappearance of Hot Star, it is good to see that the replacement store sells pretty much the same thing, The price hasn't really changed either, and with the current promotion, it is a good sell. \u2026More",

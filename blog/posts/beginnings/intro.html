                <strong>TLDR: </strong>
                I was hired as a full stack developer for my first paid project, to build a voting platform to elect prefects and captains.
                I made many mistakes, learnt alot during the process, and have come out with a newfound appreciation of well-thought out, neat & structured code.

            The breath of relief when you take when you hand in the final project, the subsequent horrors that dawn as you start to read what you‚Äôve written. 
            I thought it‚Äôd be interesting for me (possibly for you üòÅ) to take a look at what I‚Äôd written, and how it all works with a fresh set of eyes. 
            Knowing where we where we go wrong is an essential step for improvement, and hopefully this blog help to achieves this.

                A Short Introduction
            </h3>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Zac, a second year undegraduate student studying sofware engineering at the University of Western Australia (as time of writing). 
                I have an interest in web development, machine learning and data structures & algorithms and much, much more - it‚Äôs quite hard sometimes to decide what to focus my spare time on ü•≤(a curse that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre far too familiar with). 
                I have no formal experience in proper development practicies (next on the reading list + unit next semester) so please forgive the horrible mess that follows.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I started this blog to record the state of how I code. 
                I‚Äôll inspect the ugly bits of code to see how we can improve them, why it was possibly a good decision at the time, and talk about the approach & mindset I had when creating it. 
                Hopefully this is the first blog entry of many more to come - and we will see the progress that comes with experience.
            </p>

                The Opportunity
            </h3>
            <p>
                A bit of history on this project. It all began when I landed a job at my school as a helper on the IT desk. 
                Essentially, we help students and staff with their technology problems (happens quite a bit) - the broken projector in a classroom; the soft microphone during a speech; the keyboard which a student has disassembled üò° - these problems came our way and had to be fixed. 
                My general IT skills improved alot during this period thanks to the gracious mentorship of one of the senior staff (üëç thanks again if you‚Äôre reading this! üòÅ). 
            </p>

                The department knew that I had a interest in coding and approached me with developing their new voting platform to elect captains for the houses. 
                A lucky oppportunity as a second year software engineering student (there‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve turned this down).
                The software used for their previous year had broken as a result of too many students voting at once - there‚Äôs a large spike of traffic to the website when the link is sent to the students to vote, which crashed the site. 
                They wanted a voting application that could be hosted on their servers to ensure that it wouldn‚Äôt crash again. For me, that meant using PHP (which was not in my current tool kit üò∞- I think I may of heard about PHP like once before this project üòÇ).

            <h3>
                Beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
                My PHP skills were dismal to begin with - I watched some tutorials and began to toy around, learning the differences between it and my more ‚Äòfluent‚Äô languages (Python & Javascript). 
                During this I started to process through the requirements for the project, drafting up the architecture for the database and how the program would react to different types of users logging on. Setting up the SQL server and connecting to it from a PHP server was a challenge in itself, but soon enough I was able to start building the app. 
                The journey to being semi-fluent in PHP to where I could begin building took around 1 month; it‚Äôs not too distinct from other scripting languages.

                <strong>TLDR: </strong>
                Admins create a ballot and assign students to the ballot. A student logs on. 
                They see the ballots they haven’t voted for. 
                For each ballot, they choose their candidates, submitting their vote which is tallied up for the final result.

                The Project
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is the stack I worked with - Bootstrap & Jquery to make the front look nice, PHP for server side rendering and an SQL server to store the data. 
                When I started this project, I had a sense of what they each did - but I was not confident enough to start creating a web app from scratch. 
                HTML and CSS were foreign to me - the last time I had used them was for a computer science class in year 8, which I had evidently not focused enough (I had no clue how much it would’ve helped now), but after a bit of playing around with some static sites, I had gotten to a point where I knew enough to start the project.
            </p>
            <h3>PLOT TWIST - I did not 😅</h3>
            <p>
                I’ll admit - I have a tendency to run headfirst into problems, bug fixing every now and again but since all my previous projects were done for passion, rather than as an product, planning is not a number one goal. 
                Neatness and organisation of my code was nearly not as important as getting it working (which I could most of the time), but it usually ended up as a bunch of tightly linked dependent code, where a small change would result in a crash. 
                <br>
                A different mindset was required - one where tidiness was prioritised as much as getting the job done. My approach, which would begin with a small mess in one area of code which would slowly encompass the project - eventually leading to a time where less progress would be achieved by continuing to work on features instead of taking a step back and refactoring the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: I do suppose that there's no good time to start a project - it's quite hard to pinpoint a time when you can say "I'm now good enough to start".
                Better to start and realise you messed up than to never start at all.

            <p>I’ve gone through my github history and downloaded the first commit to the repository - what a throwback it is to see how far I’ve come.
                 This is still a .html file - static, without any PHP. I was testing out the features of bootstrap and how I could use them in my project.
                 I realise the name and date don’t even make sense - at least I’ve got something working at this point (laughing at myself 😂 that I pushed this without decent test variables - the reviewer probably wondered if I had gone crazy).

                At least this one has decent placeholders. 
                The manage and view ballots weren’t working at this time - I had just figured out what HTML forms were and how they worked with PHP. 
                While this iteration is rather crude, it served the basis of the project. 
                I’d done the correct step of seperating my front-end and functions, with a single utils.php file that all my functions lived in.
                A week later, I’d worked out to connect to an sql server from PHP so that I could read and create ballots from the browser.

                This is 2 weeks after the first commit. 
                After clicking on one of the ballots (figure 1), it would take you to the voting page. 
                A picture of Bob would pop up for each candidate, with their individual captions underneath their picture.

                Once my exams had finished I went in to the office to work more closely with my manager, I had to upload all my files to their servers and connect to their student database for the photos and names. 
                At this point, I did not realise how much more work was needed to be done.

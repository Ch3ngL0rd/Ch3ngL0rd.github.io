                <strong>TLDR: </strong>
                Admins create a ballot and assign students to the ballot. A student logs on. 
                They see the ballots they havenâ€™t voted for.    
                For each ballot, they choose their candidates, submitting their vote which is tallied up for the final result.

                The Project
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is the stack I worked with - Bootstrap & Jquery to make the front look nice, PHP for server side rendering and an SQL server to store the data. 
                When I started this project, I had a sense of what they each did - but I was not confident enough to start creating a web app from scratch. 
                HTML and CSS were foreign to me - the last time I had used them was for a computer science class in year 8, which I had evidently not focused enough (I had no clue how much it wouldâ€™ve helped now), but after a bit of playing around with some static sites, I had gotten to a point where I knew enough to start the project.
            </p>
            <h3>PLOT TWIST - I did not ðŸ˜…</h3>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ll admit - I have a tendency to run headfirst into problems, bug fixing every now and again but since all my previous projects were done for passion, rather than as an product, planning is not a number one goal. 
                Neatness and organisation of my code was nearly not as important as getting it working (which I could most of the time), but it usually ended up as a bunch of tightly linked dependent code, where a small change would result in a crash. 
                <br>
                A different mindset was required - one where tidiness was prioritised as much as getting the job done. My approach, which would begin with a small mess in one area of code which would slowly encompass the project - eventually leading to a time where less progress would be achieved by continuing to work on features instead of taking a step back and refactoring the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: I do suppose that there's no good time to start a project - it's quite hard to pinpoint a time when you can say "I'm now good enough to start".
                Better to start and realise you messed up than to never start at all.

            <p>Iâ€™ve gone through my github history and downloaded the first commit to the repository - what a throwback it is to see how far Iâ€™ve come.
                 This is still a .html file - static, without any PHP. I was testing out the features of bootstrap and how I could use them in my project.
                 I realise the name and date donâ€™t even make sense - at least Iâ€™ve got something working at this point (laughing at myself ðŸ˜‚ that I pushed this without decent test variables - the reviewer probably wondered if I had gone crazy).

                At least this one has decent placeholders. 
                The manage and view ballots werenâ€™t working at this time - I had just figured out what HTML forms were and how they worked with PHP. 
                While this iteration is rather crude, it served the basis of the project. 
                Iâ€™d done the correct step of seperating my front-end and functions, with a single utils.php file that all my functions lived in.
                A week later, Iâ€™d worked out to connect to an sql server from PHP so that I could read and create ballots from the browser.

                This is 2 weeks after the first commit. 
                After clicking on one of the ballots (figure 1), it would take you to the voting page. 
                A picture of Bob would pop up for each candidate, with their individual captions underneath their picture.

                Once my exams had finished I went in to the office to work more closely with my manager.
                I had to upload all my files to their servers and connect to their student database for the photos and names. 
                At this point, I did not realise how much more work was needed to be done. 
                TBH, not entirely sure if I'm allowed to share the final version (privacy & stuff like that), so...guess you can read my review instead ðŸ˜„.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: IMO, the final version looks alot more polished so take what you saw above with a grain of salt.

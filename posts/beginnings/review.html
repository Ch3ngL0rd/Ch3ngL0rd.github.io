            <h2>The Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>
                So what went well? Sometimes I find it hard to give myself credit but here goes. I‚Äôm proud of how the end product looks - but there are just so many small improvements that could‚Äôve been made to really polish it off. 
                I‚Äôm happy with how I communicated my progress to my manager - since I worked remotely I gave weekly / daily updates about what I did that day which I think worked pretty well.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the ‚Äòfinal sprint‚Äô, where I came into the office to work more closely with the database & systems guy, my proficiency in PHP was good enough where a feature could be requested and implemented by the end of the day. 
                It felt good to be able to show my accomplishments and prove that I was capable to complete the project (imposter syndrome alert üòÖ). 
                Commmunicating to make the front-end more accesible was a fun challenge where I had to make changes to the css on the fly (might‚Äôve contributed to the mess of code). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had lots of fun researching the inner workings of SQLite and the optimisations that I could do to speed up my queries (found a error where I saved picture with 30% more space than required - not an error but ‚Äòtechnical debt‚Äô per se - I knew it could be improved at the time but I was working on getting it functional first üòÇ).
                The ‚Äòfinal sprint‚Äô of the last weeks where the project began to look more like a website rather than lines of code was really rewarding, and I‚Äôd love to experience it again.

            <h2>The BAD üò§</h2>
            <p>
                Now onto the bad. There are so many things I could talk about but I‚Äôll try to keep it brief.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Structure</strong> - The way that I‚Äôve thought about this is that I tried to build good code on top of bad code, but the bad code kept bringing the good code down with it. 
                I imagine one of those jenga towers where all the bottom blocks have been taken out, while you‚Äôre trying to build eiffel tower on top - it just ain‚Äôt gon work! 
                Giving myself a planned structure of what functionalities were going to live where at the start of the project would have made my life so much easier. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Database Shortcuts</strong> (they weren't shortcuts) - Storing the houses and year groups as a comma seperated string instead of creating individual records or linking it to another table - this gave me troubles when the year groups where ‚Äô11‚Äô and ‚Äò1‚Äô, since (as far as I know) there‚Äôs no way to split a string using sqlite. 
                Instead I had recheck the results in PHP to ensure that they were right (increasing the mess)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Inconsistency of CSS</strong> - I used bootstrap but I also used my own custom css (not bad), but then I used inline css on top of that. 
                It resulted in alot of repeated code and struggling to find what was causing pixel misalignment - bootstrap, css file or inline..? - it just resulted in alot of wasted time
            </p>
            <p>And some non-code stuff that I thought was pretty relevant as well:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Giving deadlines</strong> - at the start of the project I thought that I‚Äôd be able to have this done in a month (that was when I did not even know PHP - curse my hubris). 
                Whenever I gave a deadline to which I‚Äôd finish the project, the features would be ~75% complete if that. This is a skill that I will have to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The developer mindset</strong> - The developer mindset is good when the essential and groundwork of the app is created. 
                However, when the user experience was being considered, I‚Äôd found it hard to pick out the pain points, since I‚Äôd been working on it for so long. 
                The features I thought were intuitive were only to me (I had created them after all). 
                Having a second set of eyes to look at the website from a user was a really enlightening experience.

            <h2><strike>The Ugly?</strike></h2>
            <p>
                Scrap that, I don‚Äôt think that I should dig into myself too much. Time to reflect and reward myself for what I‚Äôve accomplished. In 3 months, I have:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Delivered a efficent, functional voting platform which ticks off all the requirements that they requested</li>
                <li>Learnt a few new languages and become semi fluent in them</li>
                <li>Have a deeper understanding of how websites work and the work required that goes into creating them</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Best! ü•≥</h2>
            <p>
                This project has given me a new idea - and I can‚Äôt wait to start creating it (maybe this time I'll plan it out üòÇ)
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Taking time to think the long-term design of a project is time never wasted. While I did plan (and thought that I‚Äôd planned enough) having an extensive fully thought out plan of - I realise writing this that with this mindset I would probably never start anything (it is very easier to keep planning and never doing). Planning is still very useful!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Structure and neatness - writing code that is neat and gets the job done is far, far superior to code that just gets the code done. There were some times where I came back to my code (with a fresh set of eyes) and had no clue what a chunk of code did (even though I wrote it like the night b4).</li>
            </ol>

                That's it for now. Hope you enjoyed my rambling and reflection on my first job as developer.
                I thoroughly enjoyed the development experience - working with people to create something that saves times and people enjoy using has been rewarding.
